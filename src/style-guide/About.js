      A luxurious, photo-worthy, stress-free girls getaway is right at your
      fingertips. Brides to be, let our travel & event specialists bring your
      dream bachelorette one step closer to reality. And on the flip side, if
      you are the Maid of Honor, Mother of the Bride, or the friend that is the
      resident party planner, let Luxette help you design a girls weekend that
      the bride-to-be is sure to never forget and that you can actually enjoy.
      We specialize in white-glove customized travel planning for those groups
      looking to really go all out on this celebratory weekend. However, if you
      just need some hot spot suggestions on where to go, stay, and eat in a
      city youâ€™ve never been to, we are at your service.
