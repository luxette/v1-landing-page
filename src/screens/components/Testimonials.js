        "I had a wonderful experience planning my best friend's bachelorette party with
        Lauren! From beginning to end, Lauren was so meticulous about making sure that
        my vision for the event came to life, and that everything went off without a
        hitch. It was clear Lauren knows the best of the best when it comes to dining
        and nightlife in New Orleans - all of her restaurant recommendations were
        fantastic. I also loved all of the special touches she put in place while we
        were on the ground. Our entire party was blown away! Having her by my side was
        a HUGE help and I couldn't have done it without her (especially while working
        2 jobs!). I'd highly recommend Lauren and Luxette for any travel or event
        planning needs. 5 stars!!""

        "I couldn't have imagined a better bachelorette trip than what Lauren (of
        Luxette) and my Maid of Honor organized for me in New Orleans! The itinerary
        was so well thought out and SO much funâ€”amazing restaurants and bars, super
        fun activities, and never a dull moment with my favorite ladies. Every detail
        was impeccable, including the communication with the entire group beforehand
        (complete with a detailed itinerary and outfit planner), the way my room was
        decorated when I arrived, the hotel choice, the pre-arrangement of details at
        each restaurant, and fun and hilarious activities every step of the way! I
        would 1,000% recommend Luxette to anyone who wants to take their next friends
        trip (bachelorette or otherwise) to the next level!"
